Fraud Detection using Machine Learning | Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib

Built a fraud detection model to identify fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques.

Conducted data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering to prepare datasets for accurate predictions.

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to study transaction patterns and detect anomalies.

Applied imbalanced data handling techniques (SMOTE, under-sampling/over-sampling) to improve model performance.

Trained and evaluated multiple models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Measured performance using confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to ensure reliability in fraud detection.

Developed visualizations (distribution plots, correlation heatmaps, ROC curves) for clear data insights and model evaluation.

Delivered a scalable solution that can help financial institutions reduce losses by detecting suspicious transactions effectively.
